# Magnit

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.10.

Developed completely on Angular and its dependencies.

Every question that pops up is handled dynamically (keeping in mind the crux of hackathon). On every 'Next' a call is sent to Backend that generates questions and options dynamically linked to them along with linked Options if any.

Code initially loads the first question and the form can be filled until you see Submit. On Submit the happiness index is calculated and displayed.

The focus was on logic and loading Questions/Options dyncamically with little concentration on CSS.
